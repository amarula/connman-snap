summary: Network management framework
description: |
  ConnMan is a daemon for managing Internet connections within embedded
  device and integrates a vast range of communication features usually
  split between many daemons such as DHCP, DNS and NTP. The result of
  this consolidation is low memory consumption with a fast, coherent,
  synchronized reaction to changing network conditions.
  ConnMan is a fully modular system that can be extended, through
  plug-ins, to support all kinds of wired or wireless technologies.
  The plug-in approach allows for easy adaption and modification for
  various use cases.
